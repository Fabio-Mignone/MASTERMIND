## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/Demo.png)

Introduction:
Mastermind: Unleash the power of your intellect in this captivating JavaScript adaptation of the timeless classic, the Mastermind game! Prepare to immerse yourself in a world of code-cracking excitement as you take on the challenge of deciphering a 4-digit secret code. With a maximum of 10 attempts at your disposal, every decision counts, making each move a thrilling blend of strategy and intuition.

How to Play:
The rules are simple - you're up against the computer's hidden 4-digit code, where each digit can range from 0 to 9. Your task is to guess the code within the given attempts. After each guess, the game will provide you with valuable feedback in the form of clues. Pay close attention to these hints: they will reveal how many digits you guessed correctly and how many of them are in the right position.

## Built With
